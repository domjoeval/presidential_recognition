John McCain promised a clean campaign.
Then attacked Governor Bush with misleading ads.
McCain says he's the only candidate who can beat Gore on campaign finance.
But news investigations reveal McCain solicits money from lobbyists with interest before his committee
and pressures agencies on behalf of contributors.
He attacks special interests, but the Wall Street Journal reports
McCain's campaign is crawling with lobbyists.
His conservative hometown paper warns
it's time the rest of the nation learns about the McCain we know.
Thanks for watching.
