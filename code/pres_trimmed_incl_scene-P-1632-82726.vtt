00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
John McCain promised a clean campaign.

00:03.180 --> 00:05.420
Then attacked Governor Bush with misleading ads.

00:05.420 --> 00:09.480
McCain says he's the only candidate who can beat Gore on campaign finance.

00:09.600 --> 00:14.940
But news investigations reveal McCain solicits money from lobbyists with interest before his committee

00:14.940 --> 00:17.700
and pressures agencies on behalf of contributors.

00:18.100 --> 00:21.180
He attacks special interests, but the Wall Street Journal reports

00:21.180 --> 00:23.800
McCain's campaign is crawling with lobbyists.

00:23.960 --> 00:25.960
His conservative hometown paper warns

00:25.960 --> 00:29.200
it's time the rest of the nation learns about the McCain we know.

00:30.000 --> 00:59.980
Thanks for watching.
